Q1. To implement my code I followed Three-tier architecture approach
 - **app.js** (Presentation tier) which responsible for displaying information for users
 - **scraper.js** (Application tier) which controls an applicationâ€™s functionality by performing detailed processing.
 - **Alternative server** (Data tier) which provide an API to the application tier that exposes methods of managing the stored data
 <br> <br>
**Three-tier architecture** provides ease of maintenance of the code base, adds reliability and more independence of the code and gives you the ability to update the technology stack of one tier without impacting other areas of the application.   


Q2. There are many Node concepts to learn as a new programmer such as:
    1. Non-blocking or Asynchronous
    2. Prototypes
    3. Modules
    4. Promises
    5. Callbacks
       
   My recommendations to any person who wants to be a Node-programmer are:
    +  Avoid complexity by organizing the code into the smallest chunks possible.
    +  Know npm since it has a lot of useful and unuseful packets so use different dependencies. Put things your project needs only.
    + Use linters for detect and fix the errors easier.

Q3. As a new Node programmer, I am satisfied with my application since 
    it fulfills all the requirements, and I am especially satisfied with 
    the design pattern I followed. As for further improvement, I feel that 
    I am using many nested loops which make the code a bit complicated 
    so as an improvement these nested loops could be simplified.

Q4. My TIL for this course part that I got a better knowledge about scraping, become more familiar with npm, got a better understanding of Non-blocking or Asynchronous programming, and learn more about Promises.
