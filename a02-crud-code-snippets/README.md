### Q1

---

I followed the MVC approach to structured my code.

- Model : Which manage all the data of the application like user data and snippet code data
- View : Is how the data is displayed by rendering the hbs files and HTML files.
- Controller : Which connected the Model and View together. It takes user input, such as clicking or typing, and handles callbacks for user interactions

My thoughts behind the architecture is that it is easy to follow, ability to provide multiple views,
and faster development process.

### Q2

---

Working with MangoDB was totally new for me since it is a NoSQL database. I have experience working with mysql, but I think MangoDB
is easier to work with and faster than mysql specially when dealing with documents or JSON.

### Q3

---

I am satisfied with my application especially the architecture
because it is easy to follow and to change as well. Nevertheless, it needs some improvement in the view but since it
is a backend course I think it is fine to be like this.

### Q4

---

My TIL for this course part is :

- Gained knowledge about MongoDB and how to connect with applications.
- Improved my knowledge of express and NODE JS in general.
- Better understanding of Sessions and how to deal with them.
- Better understanding of the Security stuff like Encryption of passwords and using POST methods and cookies.

In general, it was a good assignment since I gained lots of knowledge from it. But at the same time, it was not easy to do it
since I saw lots of (YouTube), along with course from udemy to solve it.
